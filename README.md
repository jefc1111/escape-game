# escape-game
A mystery / room escape game

A collaborative project as an exercise in a small group of adults and children learning Python together. 


To get up and running I did;  
`python3 -m pip install --user pipenv`  
`pipenv install pygame` (I think you can do `pipenv run pipenv install` instead now that there is a `Pipfile.lock`)  
`pipenv run python main.py`
